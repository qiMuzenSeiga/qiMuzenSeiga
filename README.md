**Hey, English-speaking friends, Look this way!**


Hi, my name is `柒梦染星河`, You can pronounce it like `qī mèng rǎn xīng hé` in Pinyin. So excited to meet you all!

- _About names_

Pinyin is a little different from English—it has tones. But don’t worry! If you're unsure how to say them, you can just ignore the tones and say `qi meng ran xing he` instead. You can also call me `qiMeng`. 

My username `qiMuzenSeiga` can also be my English name. It’s a Japanese phonetic rendering of my Chinese name, though it doesn’t really mean anything in Japanese—just for fun!

- _About the first three lines of Chinese text_

This isn't really important, but if you're curious, you can try a translation tool to check it out.

- _About Language_

My English isn't perfect, so I often use translation tools. Thanks for bearing with me!




**最后 / Finally** 

很高兴见到你，祝你开心！

So Nice to meet you! Wishing you lots of happiness!
